# 📊 SuperStore: Sales & Profits Insights

## Authors: Nikolaos Marakis, Apostolis Karapatis

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of sales & profit data from a USA based SuperStore, aimed at uncovering key insights into sales and profit trends. The insights derived from the EDA were visualized and presented using PowerBi and Streamlit, offering interactive and dynamic views of the data.

## 🎯 Business Impact  
- **Insightful Data Visualizations:** Created comprehensive dashboards in PowerBi and interactive apps in Streamlit to display sales and profit data.
- **Strategic Decision Making:** Enabled data-driven decision-making through deep analysis of sales patterns and profitability.
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Provided user-friendly tools to explore data and derive personal insights.

## 🛠️ Technical Approach  

### **1️⃣ Data Cleaning**  
- Utilized **Pandas** to clean and prepare the dataset, ensuring data quality and reliability for analysis.

### **2️⃣ Extensive EDA**  
- Conducted a deep dive into the dataset using statistical techniques to explore various dimensions of sales and profits.
- Used **Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** alongside specialized tools for interactive data exploration.

### **3️⃣ Interactive Visualization & Presentation**  
- Developed interactive dashboards in **PowerBi**, focusing on sales trends, profit analysis, and customer behavior.
- Created a dynamic application using **Streamlit** that allows users to explore data through various filters and parameters.

### **4️⃣ Tech Stack**
Languages & Libraries: Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Interactive Dashboards: PowerBi, Streamlit
Notebook Environment: JupyterLab
